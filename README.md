   - Navigate to `Settings → System → Remote Desktop`.
   - Enable Remote Desktop and note the PC name or IP address.

2. **Configure Firewall and Network**
   - Allow RDP through Windows Defender Firewall.
   - For external access, configure port forwarding on the router and optionally change the default RDP port using the Registry Editor.

3. **Connect from the Client Machine**
   - Use the `mstsc` command to launch Remote Desktop Connection.
   - Enter the host PC name or IP address, authenticate with credentials, and connect.

### **Troubleshooting**
- **Connection Errors**: Verify RDP is enabled and check firewall settings.
